<p> Welcome to the LACE Evidence Hub. You can use this site to find or share research evidence relating to learning analytics.

<p> Learning analytics is the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, in order to understand and optimise learning and the environments in which it occurs.

<p> On this site, you can search for, or share, evidence related to these four propositions:
<ul>
	<li>Learning analytics <a href="/proposition/25/a-learning/">improve learning outcomes</a>.</li>
	<li>Learning analytics <a href="/proposition/26/b-teaching/">improve learning support and teaching</a>, including retention, completion and progression.</li>
	<li>Learning analytics <a href="/proposition/27/c-uptake/">are taken up and used widely</a>, including deployment at scale.</li>
	<li>Learning analytics <a href="/proposition/28/d-ethics/">are used in an ethical way</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p> Use the search options on the right to find evidence for and against these claims, as well as links to projects that are exploring these issues.

<p> You can filter your search in order to look for evidence related to a specific country or educational sector. You can also explore key words and tags, or focus just on positive, negative or neutral evidence.

<p> The Evidence tab above provides different ways of visualizing the evidence in the Hub.

<p> If you know of any evidence that isn't already included in the Hub, please select the 'Contribute' tab to add it.

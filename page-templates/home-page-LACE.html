<p> Welcome to the Evidence Hub for the LACE project.

<p> This site aims to gather the evidence about learning analytics, and relate it to a group of propositions. We hope that by gathering the evidence together in this way, we will get a better picture of what we know â€“ and, of course, what we don't know.

<p> Don't forget to sign up at the main <a href="http://www.laceproject.eu/">LACE website</a> for our project newsletters.
